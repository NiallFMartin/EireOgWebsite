                <h4>
                    In this Q&A we hear from quite possibly the biggest Mayo fan in history, JP Mc Loughlin.
                </h4>
                <p>
                    <b>1. Name?</b>
                    <br />JP Mc Loughlin.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>2. Position?</b>
                    <br />Wing Forward or Wing Back.  Have been corner back a lot but like James Gannon, we feel we are better out the field!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>3. When did you join Éire Óg?</b>
                    <br />2018.  When Darren called in 2017 to ask if I’d be interested it renewed my want to play again.  A certain Rossie thought I wouldn’t join!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>4. Where are you from?</b>
                    <br />Mayo.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>5. Favourite player of all time?</b>
                    <br /> Lee Keegan, the man is quality.  To be a bit non partisan, I admired Seamus Moynihan greatly as a teenager.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>6. First footballing memory?</b>
                    <br /> Vaguely remember watching the 1989 All Ireland.  I think first one is a Mayo v Roscommon game in Mc Hale Park and Enon Gavin breaking the crossbar.  The Dublin Meath 1991 saga is another early memory.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>7. First teammate you would pick for 7 a side?</b>
                    <br /> Richie for the lift as he lives beside me!!  From the team of players from last year, it’d be fellow Mayo man Paddy Costello.  Not only because he is from Mayo but he is also a quality footballer with great speed and a great engine.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>8. Best player you ever played with and against?</b>
                    <br />With - James Kavanagh (Kildare and Galway) for Athlone IT fresher team, James Coughlan (Offaly) was also quality at the time on that team.  Only played one time on the same field as David Heaney but he’d be the best player but the two James’s were regular team mates.
Against - Andy Moran (Ballaghaderreen) went on to have a great Mayo career.  He wouldn’t have been as good at the time as  the player he became but looking back he’s the best player I shared a field with, as well as Keith Higgins (Ballyhaunis)
Toughest direct opponent was Michael Conroy (Davitts) who gave me an awful time in an underage game.  A few players who’s name I don’t know have given a tough time too!!
In Vancouver, John Martyn and Eamon Quinn can cause trouble.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>9. First game in Croke Park?</b>
                    <br /> Mayo v Offaly in the 1997 All Ireland semi final.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>10. Best Éire Óg moment?</b>
                    <br />A one handed diving stop I managed to make on the goal line in a game against Fraser Valley in 2018.  But mainly it’s just been back involved in a club again and one that has lots of great lads and community.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>11. Best bar in Vancouver?</b>
                    <br /> I like going to PARQ Vancouver.  BC Kitchen for food and then up to D6 afterwards.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>12. What’s on your Spotify playlist?</b>
                    <br /> Taylor Swift for sure and a good bit of pop and country.  Usually listen to the Daily Mix playlists which has a broad mix of artists people might say I’m too old to listen to!!
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>13. Best holiday destination?</b>
                    <br /> Had a nice trip to Indonesia and Australia this year.  But my favourite place to go is to random places in the US and take in a sport event, college football being the best, rent a car and see rural America.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>14. Favourite TV programme?</b>
                    <br /> Mostly easy watching shows like Modern Family, US Office, Curb Your Enthusiasm and Homeland for some drama.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>15. Last movie you watched?</b>
                    <br /> Not a huge movie watcher, I think it was Sergio.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>16. Favourite match you've seen of all time?</b>
                    <br /> Mayo v Dublin in 2006, it had so much excitement.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>17. Your county's best player of all time?</b>
                    <br /> Lee Keegan.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>18. Best player in the game right now?</b>
                    <br /> Same as above, Lee Keegan.  Two way player who can score and shut the opposition’s best player down, pure quality.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>19. How long have you been in Vancouver?</b>
                    <br />It’ll be 9 years exactly on June 8.
                    <br />
                    <br />
                    <b>20. One must do place to visit in Vancouver?</b>
                    <br />Cypress Mountain on a clear day for skiing and take in the sunset.
